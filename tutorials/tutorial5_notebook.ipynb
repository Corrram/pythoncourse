    "This exercise will help you learn how to manipulate dates and perform date arithmetic, which is useful for analyzing timelines and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `datetime` module and create an object representing today's date. This will introduce you to creating and using date objects.\n",
    "2. Calculate the date 100 days from today using a [timedelta](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta) of 100 days.\n",
    "3. Calculate the number of days between today and December 31, 2024. This will give you practice in determining the difference between two dates.\n",
    "4. Determine the day of the week for your next birthday. This will help you practice extracting specific information from a date object. You can use the `datetime` method together with [strftime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime) to format the date.\n"

However, the program contains several bugs that prevent it from working correctly, particularly in handling datetime values when grouping sales by date. Your task is to identify and fix these bugs using a debugger."
