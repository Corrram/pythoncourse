    "### Exercise 1: Managing Files with Pathlib\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll explore Python's [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module, which offers an object-oriented approach to handling file paths. You'll practice creating directories, files, and performing file operations using `Pathlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `Path` class from `pathlib`. Create a `Path` object for the current working directory and print its path.\n",
    "2. Create a directory named `docs` in the current working directory using `Path.mkdir()`.\n",
    "3. Inside `docs`, create a file called `info.txt` and write \"Learning Pathlib is fun!\" using `write_text()`.\n",
    "4. Check if `info.txt` exists using `Path.exists()` and print a message confirming its existence.\n",
    "5. Read the contents of `info.txt` using `read_text()` and print them.\n",
    "6. Rename `info.txt` to `details.txt` using the `rename()` method.\n",
    "7. Delete `details.txt` using `unlink()`, and remove the `docs` directory using `rmdir()`.\n"

    "3. Use `shutil.copy()` to copy `data.txt` and name the copy `data_backup.txt` within the same directory.\n",
    "4. Move `data_backup.txt` to a new subdirectory `backup` inside `archive` using `shutil.move()`.\n",
    "5. Rename `data_backup.txt` inside `backup` to `backup_data.txt` using `shutil.move()`.\n",
    "6. Create a ZIP archive of the entire `archive` directory named `archive.zip` using `shutil.make_archive()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write Python functions that perform simple data validation. You will use the `raise` statement to trigger exceptions when invalid data is encountered, and you will use `try-except-else` blocks to handle these exceptions. This exercise will help you understand how to use exceptions to manage error conditions in Python without using object-oriented programming concepts.\n",

    "   - Prompt the user to enter their age. Use the `input()` function to get the age as a string and then convert it to an integer.\n",
    "   - Use a `try-except-else` block to handle any exceptions that may be raised during the validation and calculation process.\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs, print an error message. If no exception occurs, print the number of years left until retirement."
