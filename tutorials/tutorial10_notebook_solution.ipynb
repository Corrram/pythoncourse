    "### Exercise 1: Generator for a Simulated Price Path (Geometric Brownian Motion)\n",
    "\n",
    "In empirical finance, asset prices are often modeled as stochastic processes. In this exercise, you will implement a generator that produces a simulated price path step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the price process follows **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. In discrete time with step size `dt`, one common simulation scheme is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{t+dt} = S_t \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{dt}\\, Z_t\\right),\n",
    "\\quad Z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a generator function `gbm_prices(S0, mu, sigma, dt, n_steps)` that yields a stream of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `numpy.random.normal(0, 1)` to generate the normal shocks \\(Z_t\\).\n",
    "2. The generator should start at `S0` and yield prices one-by-one using `yield`.\n",
    "3. Yield tuples `(t, S_t)` where `t` is the current time (starting at `0.0`) and `S_t` is the current simulated price.\n",
    "4. Demonstrate that your generator is lazy by:\n",
    "   - creating the generator object,\n",
    "   - calling `next()` a few times manually,\n",
    "   - and then iterating over the remaining values in a `for` loop.\n",
    "5. Using the stream of generated prices, compute the **running mean** of the simulated price (online, without storing all prices in a list). Print the final running mean after the simulation ends.\n",

    "- `2B` (Doubles): hits where the batter reaches second base  \n",

    "- `HR` (Home Runs): hits where the batter scores directly  \n",
    "- `BB` (Walks): batter reaches first base due to four balls  \n",
    "- `HBP` (Hit By Pitch): batter is awarded first base after being hit  \n",

    "- Maintain a **private** stats container holding batting totals (counts such as `AB`, `H`, `BB`, `HR`, ...)\n",
    "- Provide access to the stats through a `@property` (read-only; do not expose the private container directly)\n",
    "- Implement a method that updates season totals by adding new game totals (counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Implement player performance metrics (computed properties)\n",
    "Implement computed properties for:\n",
    "- Batting Average (BA)\n",
    "- On-Base Percentage (OBP)\n",
    "- Slugging Percentage (SLG)\n",
    "- OPS = OBP + SLG\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Compare players by performance\n",
    "- Implement comparison so players can be sorted by performance (use OPS as the default ranking)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Create a `Team` class\n",
    "- Attributes: `name` and a container of `players`\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "  - add players\n",
    "  - list players\n",
    "  - return top-n players by OPS\n",
    "- Implement a team-level metric (e.g. average OPS across players)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Create an `Analyst` class (inherits from `Person`)\n",

    "- Method: produce a ranking report for a given team (top players + team summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. Test scenario\n",
    "Create:\n",
    "- one team\n",
    "- one analyst\n",
    "- multiple players with different season totals\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercise 4: Formula 1 Data Science \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been offered a short internship in the data science unit of a Formula 1 team. Your group supports race-weekend decisions by combining telemetry, lap-time data, and simulation-based strategy evaluation. Your job is to build a small **object-oriented** system that stores lap times for multiple drivers and produces simple performance summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is inspired by how modern teams operate at scale: data engineering + modeling + fast reporting for engineers and strategists. A high-profile example is **Oracle Red Bull Racing**, where analytics and simulation play a central role in race preparation and strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further reading (optional):**\n",
    "- “Turning data into decisions” (Oracle Red Bull Racing): [Oracle blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/connect/oracle-red-bull-racing-turns-data-into-decisions)\n",
    "- Hands-on (optional): [Oracle LiveLabs workshop](https://livelabs.oracle.com/ords/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=909)\n",
    "\n",
    "One core task in race analysis is turning raw lap time sequences into decision-ready metrics (pace and consistency). Your goal here is not realism, but clean, reusable code structure that matches how analysis tooling is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a `Person` class\n",
    "- Attributes: `name`, `age`\n",
    "- Implement `__str__`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create a `Driver` class (inherits from `Person`)\n",
    "- Attributes: `driver_id`, `team_name`\n",
    "- Maintain a **private** container of lap times (seconds)\n",
    "- Provide access through a `@property` (do not expose the private container directly)\n",
    "- Method to add lap times\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Implement driver metrics (computed properties)\n",
    "Implement computed properties for:\n",
    "- Best lap time\n",
    "- Average lap time\n",
    "- A simple consistency metric (e.g. standard deviation of lap times)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compare drivers by performance\n",
    "- Implement comparisons so drivers can be sorted by performance (lower average lap time is better)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Create a `Session` class\n",
    "- Attributes: `name` (e.g. `\"FP1\"`), `track`, and a container of drivers\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "  - register drivers\n",
    "  - record laps for a driver\n",
    "  - compute a leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Create an `Engineer` class (inherits from `Person`)\n",
    "- Attributes: `employee_id`, `area` (e.g. `\"Performance\"`)\n",
    "- Method: produce a session report (leaderboard + summary stats)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Test scenario\n",
    "Create:\n",
    "- one session with a track name\n",
    "- one engineer\n",
    "- multiple drivers with lap times\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "- record laps (for each driver)\n",
    "- print a leaderboard and show sorting works\n"

    "### Optional Exercise: OOP Practice with `turtle` \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we introduced the core OOP ideas you will repeatedly use in applied work: **classes**, **objects**, **state**, and **methods**. In empirical projects, these ideas help you structure code so that it is readable, reusable, and easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an optional, hands-on way to practice, Python’s built-in `turtle` library provides immediate visual feedback: when an object’s state changes (position, heading, pen state), you can see the result instantly.   \n",
    "This makes it a useful sandbox for building intuition about how methods operate on object state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Official references:**\n",
    "- [turtle — Turtle graphics (Python docs)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)\n",
    "- [Turtle methods (`forward`, `left`, `penup`, `pendown`, ...)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle-methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "What to focus on (application of the OOP basics):\n",
    "- Define a class that *encapsulates* a turtle object and exposes higher-level methods.\n",
    "- Use instance attributes to represent **state** (e.g., current position, step counter).\n",
    "- Separate responsibilities: one object draws, another controls logic (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible, small extensions:\n",
    "- Add a `steps` counter and a method that moves the turtle and updates the counter.\n",
    "- Add a method `draw_square(size)` that draws a square starting at the turtle’s current position.\n",
    "- Add a method `random_walk(n_steps, step_length)` that performs a random walk (left/right turns), while tracking turns."
