    "### Exercise 1: Generator for a Simulated Price Path (Geometric Brownian Motion)\n",
    "\n",
    "In empirical finance, asset prices are often modeled as stochastic processes. In this exercise, you will implement a generator that produces a simulated price path step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the price process follows **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. In discrete time with step size `dt`, one common simulation scheme is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{t+dt} = S_t \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{dt}\\, Z_t\\right),\n",
    "\\quad Z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a generator function `gbm_prices(S0, mu, sigma, dt, n_steps)` that yields a stream of prices.\n",

    "1. Use `numpy.random.normal(0, 1)` to generate the normal shocks \\(Z_t\\).\n",
    "2. The generator should start at `S0` and yield prices one-by-one using `yield`.\n",
    "3. Yield tuples `(t, S_t)` where `t` is the current time (starting at `0.0`) and `S_t` is the current simulated price.\n",
    "4. Demonstrate that your generator is lazy by:\n",
    "   - creating the generator object,\n",
    "   - calling `next()` a few times manually,\n",
    "   - and then iterating over the remaining values in a `for` loop.\n",
    "5. Using the stream of generated prices, compute the **running mean** of the simulated price (online, without storing all prices in a list). Print the final running mean after the simulation ends.\n",
